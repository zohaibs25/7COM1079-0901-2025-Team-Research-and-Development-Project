Problem statement and research motivation
High unemployment in the long term has significant economic and social burdens such as lost output, decreased tax revenues and greater inequality. The question of whether U.S. metropolitan labour markets returned to pre-1990s levels following several recessions (1990-91, 2001, 2007-09) is essential in determining macroeconomic resilience over the long term and the success of stabilisation policies (Blanchard and Katz, 1992). As the U.S. has been undergoing the longest period in its history of growth as of 2016, exploring whether average unemployment has gone back to or below the levels of the early 1990s gives a valuable indicator of the normalisation of labour markets.
